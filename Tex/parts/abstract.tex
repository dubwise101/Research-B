	Ajax is a collection of web technologies utilised to provide a richer user experience when browsing the Internet. It acts as an intermediary layer between the user and the server, which allows for asynchronous communication. This means that the user does not have to wait for the server anymore to reload entire pages. But there are downsides as well, for example with regard to privacy: Ajax can be used to turn the browser into a surveillance and profiling tool. All activities of the user can be logged and then used to build profiles or draw (presumed) conclusions about users.\\ The objective of this research is to give an overview of Ajax and its current usage. This usage will be studied by analyzing a few popular websites, to show how they make use of Ajax. To demonstrate the possibilities of this technology I utilise UsaProxy, a proxy that logs all Ajax interactions on a website. I also developed a web application that is able to parse these logs and derive information about a user from it. After discussing the results of this experiment I draw conclusions and make predictions about Ajax in terms of technology and privacy. I will also discuss legal and technical measures to help prevent against Ajax privacy infringements.\\
