	Ajax is a collection of web technologies that provide for a richer user experience when browsing the internet. It acts as an intermediary layer between the user and the server, which allows for asynchronous communication. This means that the user does not have to wait for the server anymore to reload entire pages. But there are downsides as well, for example with regard to privacy: Ajax can be used to turn the browser into a surveillance and profiling tool. All activities of the user can be logged and then used to build profiles or draw (presumed) conclusions about users. The objective of this research is to give an overview of Ajax and the current use of it. This usage will be studied by analyzing a few popular websites, to show how they make use of Ajax. To demonstrate the possiblities of this technology I utilize UsaProxy, a proxy that logs all Ajax interactions on a website. I also developed a web application that is able to parse these logs and derive information of a user from it. After discussing the results of this demonstration I will draw conclusions and make predictions about the Ajax technology in terms of technology and privacy. I will also discuss the development of a browser add-on to detect Ajax privacy infringements.\\
